# Arduino-Motion
Required Arduino Components: Adafruit IL19341 (LCD Display), Arduino Uno (Board) and Parrallax PING (sensor). 
Very simple program that utilizes that the PING to detect movement and print the distance away in which the movement is occuring, in either (m) or (cm). The only issue with this program is that it can only print a certain amount of distances on the LCD display since it is unable to use vertical scrolling due to buggs with it's SPI.
